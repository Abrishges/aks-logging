# aks-logging

This contains the sourcecodes for 3 types of logging which are easy to implement when using Azure Kubernetes Service.

- The default out of the box logging, using log analytics and needs no additional configuration. Usage of this is shown in my youtube channel. No sourcecode for this.
- EFK stack; stands for ElesticSearch FluentD and Kibana and is excellent for centralized application logging.
- Prometheus; execellent timelaps data solution for near realtime logging of infrastructural events
